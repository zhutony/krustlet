# Krustlet: Kubernetes Kubelet in Rust for running WASM

:construction: :construction: **This project is highly experimental.** :construction: :construction:
It should not be used in production workloads.

Krustlet acts as a Kubelet by listening on the event stream for new pods that
the scheduler assigns to it based on specific Kubernetes
[tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/).

The default implementation of Krustlet listens for the architecture `wasm32-wasi` and schedules
those workloads to run in a `wasmtime`-based runtime instead of a container runtime.
